# Time Series Modeling

This is the final work of the Time Series Analysis class, the model used maximum temperature data from Porto Alegre between 2012 and 2023 and was built using ARIMA and SARIMA models. You can see the final rendered report at my [RStats](https://rpubs.com/joaolsimon1/time_series_modeling) and download the original data from the [INMET](https://portal.inmet.gov.br/dadoshistoricos) website.
